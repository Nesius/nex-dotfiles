# nex-dotfiles
My personal dotfiles, mostly for my own ease of installation

Tools you will need:
Waybar
LabWC Window Manager
Oh-my-BASH
SwayNC
Wofi

I based the WM theme on an older OpenBox gruvbox theme but I added white borders to help differentiate the windows from each other, since they were hard to tell from each other previously.

Other than that, it's mostly self-explanatory. I'm not going to explain how it all works.
